      Hi ðŸ‘‹, I am James Garcia. I have been in tech in some form of capacity for over 10 years. Still learning and still loving it. I am grateful to have been in this field because it has provided for me and my family. While I don't work as a full-time Rails developer I have created a Rails app <a href="https://sharedwise.com">Sharedwise</a>. It is a blogging platform where a user creates a "Collection", which is basically an organizational unit, and then create post under the collection that are of a similar topic. People have different interest and so this will help them to have different collections based on those interest.
